# Bulls and Cows

This program is a console-based game called "Bulls and Cows". The objective of the game is to guess a secret code generated by the computer.

## How to Play

1. Run the program in your preferred Java development environment or compile and execute the `Main.java` file.

2. The program will prompt you to input the length of the secret code. Enter a positive integer value greater than 0 and press Enter.

3. Next, you will be asked to input the number of possible symbols in the code. Again, enter a positive integer value greater than 0 and press Enter.

   **Note:** The maximum number of possible symbols is 36 (0-9, a-z).

4. The program will generate a secret code using the provided length and symbols. The secret code will be masked with asterisks.

5. On each turn, you need to enter your guess for the secret code. Enter a string of characters matching the length of the secret code and press Enter.

6. After each guess, the program will provide feedback in the form of bulls and cows. A bull represents a correct digit in the correct position, while a cow represents a correct digit in the wrong position.

7. Use the feedback to refine your guesses and continue making new guesses until you correctly guess the secret code.

8. Once you guess the correct code, the program will display a congratulatory message.

## Example

Here's an example interaction with the program:

```
Input the length of the secret code:
4
Input the number of possible symbols in the code:
6
The secret is prepared: **** (0-5)
Okay, let's start a game!
Turn 1:
1234
Grade: 2 bull(s) 1 cow(s).
Turn 2:
5678
Grade: 0 bull(s) 0 cow(s).
Turn 3:
3412
Grade: 3 bull(s) 0 cow(s).
Turn 4:
3415
Grade: 3 bull(s) 0 cow(s).
Turn 5:
3410
Grade: 4 bull(s) 0 cow(s).
Congratulations! You guessed the secret code.
```

## Error Handling

The program includes error handling for the following scenarios:

- If it's not possible to generate a code with the specified length and number of unique symbols, an `IndexOutOfBoundsException` will be thrown.

- If the maximum number of possible symbols in the code exceeds 36, an `IllegalArgumentException` will be thrown.

- If an invalid number is entered as input, an `InputMismatchException` will be thrown.
